The objective of this assignment is to implement several of the path planning
algorithms described in this chapter. The a map is created similar to those
shown in figures 12.11 and 12.12. The file draw_map.py, and draw_path.py draws
the map, the waypoint path, and the current straight-line or orbit that is
being followed. The file path_planner.py contains a switch statement for
manually choosing between different path planning algorithms. 

12.1 Using "mavsim_chap12.py" Run the file using planner_flag = 'simple_straight'
as an example. Implement "rrt_dubins.py" and set the planner_flag = 'simple_straight'
to plan Dubins paths through the map. Implement the RRT algorithm based on Du-
bins paths and the associated smoothing algorithm. Test and debug
the algorithm on the guidance model given in equation (9.18). When
the algorithm is working well on the guidance model, verify that it
performs adequately for the full six-DOF model.
