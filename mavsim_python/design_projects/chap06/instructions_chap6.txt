The objective of this assignment is to implement the lateral and longitudinal
autopilots, as described in this chapter. You can use either successive loop
closure, total energy control, or LQR.

    - Implement either "autopilot.py", "autopilot_lqr.py" or "autopilot_tec.py".
    - Tune gains in the "control_parameters.py" file.

6.1 Implement the longitudinal autopilot and tune the gains. The input the
longitudinal autopilot is the commanded airspeed and the commanded
altitude. To make the process easier, you may want to initialize the
system to trim inputs and then tune airspeed control first, followed by
the pitch loop, and then the altitude loop.

6.2 Implement the lateral autopilot. The input to the lateral autopilot is the
commanded course angle.

6.3 Test the autopilot using a variety of different step inputs on the com-
manded airspeed, altitude, and course angle. Be sure to command
course angles that are greater than Â±180 degrees.

  - Record or demonstrate your autopilot animation and graphs
