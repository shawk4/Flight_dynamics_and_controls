3.1 Implement the MAV equations of motion given in equations (3.14)
through (3.17) of the textbook. Assume that the inputs are the forces and moments
applied to the MAV in the body frame. Changeable parameters should
include the mass, the moments and products of inertia, and the initial
conditions for each state. Use the parameters given in appendix E.
    - Implement the "derivatives()" function in "mav_dynamics_forces.py".

3.2 Verify that the equations of motion are correct by individually set-
ting the forces and moments along each axis to a nonzero value and
convincing yourself that the simulated motion is appropriate.
    - Run "mavsim_chap3.py, then modify forces and verify your model.
    - Save a video or demonstrate a couple different run cases.

3.3 Since Jxz is non-zero, there is gyroscopic coupling between roll and
yaw. To test your simulation, set Jxz to zero and place nonzero mo-
ments on l and n and verify that there is no coupling between the
roll and yaw axes. Verify that when Jxz is not zero, there is coupling
between the roll and yaw axes.
    - Save a video or demonstrate both of these cases.
