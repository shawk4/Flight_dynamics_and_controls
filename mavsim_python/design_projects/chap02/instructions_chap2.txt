""The objective of this assignment is to create a 3D rendering of a MAV
  that correctly displays the rotated and translated state of the MAV. Creating
  animations is described in Appendix D and example files are contained on
  the textbook website""

2.1 Read Appendix D and study carefully the spacecraft animation on the
textbook website.

2.2 Create an animation drawing of the aircraft shown in Figure 2.14.
	- Complete each TODO section in the "draw_mav.py" file
     
2.3 Exercise your animation model by moving your aircraft through var-
ious sequences of rotations and translations. Verify that your results
make sense.
	- Run the "mavsim_chap2.py" launch file
  - Save a recording using "video_writer.py" or use your own method
    to record a video. Or demonstrate your program.
